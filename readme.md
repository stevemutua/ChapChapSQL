## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
```shell
git clone http://github.com/kelvinkamau/chapchapsql
```

## Prerequisites
You need the following to install and use the project:
- **Web server** - tool for running the PHP scripts, for example, [Apache Web Server](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi)
- **Database server** - RDBMS database program, [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
- **Web browser** - tool to preview the result, for example, [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- **Text Editor** - tool for editing your code, for example, [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.4.1.html)

**NOTE:** *This document does not contain steps on how to setup or configure the above tools; it is assumed that you're already familiar with this as well as the process of creating a dummy site and deploying it on a local (or online) server.*

## Installing
To use chapchapsql, add the following at the beginning of your PHP code in your working script:
```php
<?php
require_once("chapchapsql.min.php");
?>
```



## Testing (Sandbox)
Build & test your project that uses this library in a controlled & real free environment with this easy to use simulator by visiting the ChapChapSQL SandBox.

```shell
http://www.kelvinkamau.com/sandbox
```

## Running tests locally
To run tests, [visit the online demo](http://github.com/kelvinkamau/ChapChapSQL
or see the [DEMO/README.md](./demo/README.md) file for notes on how to test locally.

## Deployment
To deploy this project on a live system, copy the distribution folder to your working environment:
```shell
git clone http://github.com/kelvinkamau/chapchapsql/dist
cp dist /your/path
```
Next, provide valid database credentials in the [credentials file](dist/credentials.json) as follows:
```json
{
  "database_type"   : "",
  "host_name"       : "",
  "host_username"   : "",
  "host_password"   : "",
  "database"        : ""
}
```
Finally, include chapchapsql in your working scripts, and configure it:
```php
<?php
require_once("dist/chapchapsql.min.php");

// create a new instance
$conn = new chapchapsql();

// provide credentials
$conn->set_credentials_via_json_file("dist/credentials.json");

// (optional) enable error logging
$conn->set_logs_file_path("dist/logs.json");
$conn->set_logs_minify(true);

// your code follows here
// [...]

// destroy instance
$conn->__destruct();
unset($conn);
?>
```

## Usage
For guidelines on how to use ChapChapSQL, see the [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) file or [visit the project site](https://github.com/kelvinkamau/chapchapsql/blob/master/USAGE.md).

## Built With
- [PHP 7.0](http://php.net/) - The web framework used
- [PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) - The framework linking PHP to the Database

## Documentation
ChapChapSQL uses an object-oriented approach highly facilitated by mixed inheritance, a combination of single and multilevel inheritance. For the classes' UML and relationship diagrams, see the [UML.jpg](./UML.jpg) file for more details. A full list of the classes is available in the [UML.md](./UML.md) file, and the [unminified source code](./dist/chapchapsql.php) contains a description of the entire codebase.

## Contributing
ChapChapSQL is an open source software project and I encourage developers to contribute patches and code for us to include in the main package of ChapChapSQL. All contributions will be fully credited - see the [Contributing.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for details on my code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests.
